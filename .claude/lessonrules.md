*Lesson Rules*
This document provides rules for the Farsi lessons to make sure that they progress naturally for users. The goal is that users / students on Learn Farsi have natural progression of the words and difficulty so that they feel like they are progressing and at the same time are remembering words.

*Lesson progression*
- Beginner level lessons should have less words per lesson, for exmaple closer to 5. 
- As the user progresses through lessons and / or difficulty improves more words can be introduced to each lesson. Really hard dificulty lessons can have even more than 10+ or 15+ words. This gives a naturall progression. 
- Lessons should progress according to also the word difficulty. For example, It is ok for beginner lessons to have beginner and elementary and maybe even some intermediate difficulty tagged words. But the focus should be on the beginner words. This also means that when the student progresses to higher difficulty lessons more intermediate, advanced and expert words slowly get introduced according tot lesson difficulty they are at. 

*Daily Practice*
- The daily practice should take random words to practice for the student / user. 
- The words selected should focus on words that have been filled in wrong more frequently by the user. This helps the user to learn words they struggle with. As they start having this word correct more other words are presented that the user has dificulty with. 
- The words provided in a daily practice lesson should be related to the difficulty level that the student is at. This means, that if the user is still at a beginner level with their lessons that it is more likely for those difficulty level words to show up. This doesn't mean that higher difficulty words will not show up. Just their likelyhood might be slightly less. 
- When the user progresses in difficulty, also the words in the daily practice lesson should match more and more the difficulty that the user is at.
