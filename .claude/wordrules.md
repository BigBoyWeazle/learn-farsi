_Word Rules_
This document provides rules for the Farsi Words and Farsi Word Library on the Learn Farsi website. These rules help the farsi words on the website to be portraid consistently.

_Conversational Farsi words_

- The focus is to have conversational farsi words.
- That means that the website should use more informal / spoken versions of the words where possible.
- This means that for certain words the aa sound is spoken as oo, for example naan in conversational farsi is spoken as noon.
- Make sure to focus on spoken farsi only for words where it is relevant.

_No double words_

- I want to prevent double words in the library.
- It is ok to have multiple different words that have the same meaning, like mamnoon and mersi, two different words for thanks / thank you. But I want to prevent that the same word appears tries. Duplicate words should therefore be removed.
- Because farsi is written phonetically duplicate words can arise easily, like rooye is sometimes written as ruye, as a result this word appears two times with two different phonetic writings. Make sure to keep only one so the student is not confused (keep rooye in this case).

_Word difficulty_

- The word difficulty tags given to words should make sense.
- This means that very common used words should be given lower difficulty.
- Shorter words should have tendency to be a less high difficulty level depending on the meaning.
- Longer words or sentences should be given a higher difficulty tag.
- Niche words, for example in specific niches, like work, industries etc., can be given higher difficulty. For example
- Uncommon phrasal verbs can be higher difficulty (like Dast Keshidan, to give up)
- Sayings should be a high difficulty
